As a postdoc in the [Vector Genetics Laboratory](https://vectorgeneticslab.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis, I studied the landscape ecology of *Anopheles* mosquitoes in São Tomé and Príncipe. Mosquitoes are the deadliest animals in the world, responsible for transmitting diseases like malaria, which continues to pose a major public health challenge. My research integrated remote sensing, ecological modeling, and landscape genetics to understand how habitat structure influences mosquito movement and population connectivity. These insights are critical for vector control strategies, including genetically engineered mosquitoes, a key focus of our lab. Our findings were recently published in [*Landscape Ecology*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-025-02059-3).

In addition to my landscape ecology research, I had the opportunity to participate in a mark-release-recapture experiment, contributing to efforts to track mosquito dispersal and survival in the field. I also conducted a predator growth rate study with jumping spiders (*Phidippus audax*), incorporating my background in arachnology into my mosquito research. This interdisciplinary perspective has helped me explore ecological interactions across different taxa and develop a broader understanding of predator-prey dynamics. Look out for both of these research findings soon!
