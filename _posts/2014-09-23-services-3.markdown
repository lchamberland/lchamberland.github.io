title: Spider Phylogenetics and Biogeography

My PhD research focused on the island biogeography of Caribbean spiders, including the net-casting spider (Family: Deinopidae), published in the [*Journal of Biogeography*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13431) and the spiny-backed orb weaver (*Gasteracantha cancriformis*), published in [*PeerJ*](https://peerj.com/articles/8976/). Using molecular methods, I investigated their evolutionary history, population genetics, and distribution patterns across the Caribbean Archipelago. During a postdoc at UC Davis, I led research focused on the the evolution of eye size in the net-casting spider, published in [*Scientific Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22157-5). I also had the opportunity to apply high-throughput sequencing to begin to uncover the phylogeography of trapdoor spiders across the California Floristic Province, examining how historical and ecological processes have shaped their genetic diversity and range.
