<p> Appropriately named the ogre-faced spiders, <i>Deinopis</i> are genus within the family Deinopidae that have a pair of enlarged posterior median eyes (PME) used for hunting at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3595122/The-spider-NIGHTVISION-goggles-Arachnid-uses-enlarged-eyes-help-hunt-prey-ground-night.html">night</a>. These eyes are incredibly light sensitive letting in 2000 times more light than the average human eye! Our molecular phylogentic study of <a href= https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13431>deinopids</a> revealed that, remarkably, <i>Deinopis</i> is not monophyletic, and its sister genus,<i>Menneus</i>, which has typically sized PMEs, is nested within. I am currently working on a global phylogenetic revision and biogeography of this family.  </p>

<p> <i>Gasteracantha</i> is a widespread genus of web-building spiders with striking color polgymorphisms and variation in spine number, which have puzzed taxonomists. We found evidence for a single species in the Caribbean, <i>G. cancriformis</i>, with recently divergent lineages in the North, Central, and South America.
