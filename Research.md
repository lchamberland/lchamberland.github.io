    <h2><i>Deinopidae (the net-casting/ogre-faced spiders)</i></h2>

<p> Appropriately named the ogre-faced spiders, <i>Deinopis</i> are genus within the family Deinopidae that have a pair of enlarged posterior median eyes (PME) used for hunting at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3595122/The-spider-NIGHTVISION-goggles-Arachnid-uses-enlarged-eyes-help-hunt-prey-ground-night.html">night</a>. These eyes are incredibly light sensitive letting in 2000 times more light than the average human eye! Our most recent <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13431">study</a> recent study found that <i>Deinopis</i> is not monophyletic, and its sister genus,<i>Menneus</i>, which has typically sized PMEs, is nested within. I am currently working on a global phylogenetic revision of this family.  </p>

    <h2><i>Gasteracantha</i></h2>

<p> <i>Gasteracantha</i> is a widespread genus of web-building spiders with incredibly diverse color polymorphisms. Also known as the spiny-backed orb-weavers", these spiders have abdominal spines that are hypothesized to deter predators, primarily birds, while they hang out in the middle of their webs during the day. The goal of my research is to use molecular data to test the hypothesis that there is one species of <i>Gasteracantha</i>, <i>G. cancriformis</i> in the Caribbean. Furthermore, do we see geographic or genetic trends or clustering of these color polymorphisms?
