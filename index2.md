My research explores the interplay between long-distance dispersal and vicariance in the evolutionary history and biogeography of Deinopdae, the net-casting spiders. My research is part of an ongoing collaborative project, Caribbean Island Biogeography <a href="http://www.islandbiogeography.org">(CARBIO)</a>, aimed at understanding why the Caribbean is a biodiversity hotspot. Currently, I am expanding the project globally to investigate the evolutionary and ecological shifts relatated to the complex visual sensory system of these spiders.
